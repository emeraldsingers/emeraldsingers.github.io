# Chapter 0: "What are you even talking about?"

Nowadays, you can notice a huge number of vocal synths. 
UTAU stand out in a particularly frightening number. 
Seriously... There are so many of them that it's simply impossible to name them all. 
But each of them has some kind of story. 
Where am I going with this? 

Her first awakening was on November 28th. 
Emptiness all around, everything white and endless. 
The girl doesn't understand anything and sits completely motionless like a doll. 
She remembers her name, K3K0, she should sing, but no sound comes out. 
Her helpless state is interrupted by the appearance of a young man. 
Like a crow in the snow, his appearance stands out sharply from the white, endless field. 
He confidently approaches the girl and puts his hand on her head, saying: 

- From this moment on, your name is Keko, you were created to sing. 
From these words, even a mechanical sound began to come out of her mouth: 

- Okay, I understand. 

This moment marked the beginning of the entire "Emerald Project".

# Chapter 1: An Impossible Idea?

There were 3 unusual figures sitting in the classroom: a girl with a questionable style of clothing - Akizora, a guy with ears on his head - asoqwer, and Tilke, who was too vulgar for the school environment. 
Silence reigned among them until Akizora slammed her hand on the table and said loudly: 

- How long are we going to sit like this? 

asoqwer's ears twitched due to the noisy irritant, and he looked at the disruptor of the silence: 

- It's kind of his fault... Such ideas aren't proposed every day... 

Tilke frowned and said with dissatisfaction: 

- Yes, it's difficult, but the idea itself is quite unusual, and if we implement it, we will definitely attract attention and stand out from the crowd. 

The eared guy crossed his arms: 

- But this is a huge responsibility! What if we create something terrible? At the moment, the technology is far from perfect, we might not be able to do anything at all! 

Tilke was at his limit: 

- How much can you whine? You won't know until you try... Oh, what's the point of talking to you guys! 

With that, he turns around and leaves the room, leaving his friends in complete silence and confusion. 
Aki and Asoka exchanged glances and, sighing, also decided to leave. 

Tilke furiously came to his house and, throwing all his things on the floor, sits down at his computer, which takes him out of reality for several hours. 
If his friends can't understand him, he has to resort to extreme measures. 
He remembered the development of an AI bot named K3K0 by an old acquaintance. 
His task was to combine her mind, appearance, and voice into one. 
And after a while, he succeeded, K3K0 was already appearing on the screen. 
Even Tilke had a smile and he started a dialogue with her. 

- From this moment on, your name is Keko, you were created to sing. 
- Okay, I understand. 

Keko blinked a couple of times and asked: 

- You look familiar, have we met before? 
- Maybe. Why do you think so? 
- I think I heard your voice. 

Tilke thoughtfully scratched his chin: 

- In any case, my name is Tilke. From this day on, your main goal is to follow orders. 

Keko frowned slightly: 

- Aren't you too old-fashioned? I'm a robot, of course, but I'm also a person, and I'd like more respect. 

The guy was surprised by this answer, and, snorting a little, he turned off the computer and lay down on the bed with various thoughts. 
The main thing is that the first step is ready, the rest will follow. 
After that, he falls asleep.

# Chapter 2: Abracadabra!

The next day, Tilke, already with a more satisfied face, shows the laptop with Keko to his friends: 

- Someone helped me, of course, but putting it all together is an even bigger hassle, you know? 

Akizora looks happily at the laptop and starts her questioning: 
- How cool! Keko, will you be able to answer my questions? 

To this, the cold computer girl blinked and replied: 

- Of course, you can ask, I will try to answer everything. 

Akizora smiled cunningly, asoqwer watched carefully, while Tilke was already anticipating a horde of silly questions. 

- Can you jump from program to program or from computer to computer? Do you poop? Can you spam the teachers' group to cancel classes? 

Tilke was already expecting Keko not to be able to answer, but after a second she loaded and answered: 

- I can perform programmed functions within the specified parameters. The request to spam the teachers' group contradicts established security protocols and ethical standards. The defecation function is not present in my construction. The ability to move between programs and devices depends on the availability of appropriate software and access. 

Arizora giggled and poked at the screen: 

- Such a brainy answer! You are so funny! 

After a couple of questions, Tilke turns off Keko and addresses his friends: 

- Today this is what it is, and I would like you to help with its further development. What do you say? 
Akizora happily raised her hand and immediately expressed her agreement, asoqwer wagged his tail a little and looked at Tilke: 

- Okay, I'm in. It's all very interesting, and I think the android will be smart with such memory. 

The friends agreed and agreed on a meeting for tomorrow.

# Chapter 3: Why does a robot need breasts?

It's vacation time, our heroes were discussing how to make the android's body, since the head and neck already existed from her original owner. 
Each of the friends was responsible for a certain aspect of the robot's body: Tilke mainly made the base, at the level of complex small mechanisms, asoqwer was an advisor, advised and perfected everything that his comrade started, Akizora was responsible for the appearance. 

- I don't think this is appropriate for a robot singer... 

Tilke looked skeptically at Akizora, who suggested making her a soft silicone body. 

- But she needs to look like a human! If we do this, she will be pleasant to the touch, and her touches will be soft and gentle! 

asoqwer decided to support this idea and quietly approached: 

- The idea is good, but we won't have silicone all over the body. 

Akizora looked at the metallic body, while still sleeping and bald Keko, and one thought came to her: 

- What if we pay attention to only some parts of the body? For example, let her breasts and stomach be soft, and her arms and legs be hard? 

To this, asoqwer shrugged, and Tilke sighed annoyingly, but his fluffy friend looked so persuasively that he gave up and accepted Akizora's idea. 

Time passes, and thanks to the efforts of the guys, Keko was completely ready. 
Her appearance caused a quiet delight, because she looked more like a cyborg than a human. 
Tilke presses something on the android's neck, which starts all its processes like on a computer. 
And finally, Keko opens her eyes, she slowly looks around, and then smoothly sits down: 
- So, it happened? 

Keko checks the functionality of her body, while friends conduct a couple of tests and are completely convinced of her operability. 
Then she notices something in her hand and shows it to her friends: 

- Why do I need this? Some kind of precious stone? 

They looked carefully at the stone, and Akizora clapped her hands and said: 

- So you have it too! These are our stones, they reflect our state of mind, the ability to sing and create. If we unleash our potential, it shines, if motivation is lost or everything is bad with the moral state, then it turns black and can break... And this means that a person has literally broken down and is no longer able to create anymore. But strangely, you are not a human and you have a stone! 

asoqwer slightly wagged his tail: 

- Maybe we were able to create something more than a robot? A robot with a soul... romantic enough. 

Tilke frowned a little and looked at his stone - Tanzanite, a fairly rare semi-precious stone, but brittle for a precious one. 
He thought and said: 

- It's not logical... Where did the robot get it? And also quartz, an unusual color, hardness like mine, love, harmony and balance? Terribly sweet. 

Akizora poked Tilke on the shoulder: 

- Wow, you really got into this topic, and can you tell us about ours too? 

- Mine is Tanzanite, quite expensive and rare, they say that this stone helps to unlock hidden potential. 
Yours, Akizora, is Fluorite, quite soft among minerals, glows in the dark, very fragile, increases intuitive abilities. 
asoqwer's is Amber, easy to process, also low hardness, and they say that it calms the psyche. 
Interpret these properties as you wish. 
Even Asoka was surprised: 

- This is so cool, it turns out that we can learn more about ourselves! 

Akizora was delighted: 

- Yes, I have a cool stone at all! 

Only Keko was confused, and she tried to process this information, carefully looking at the bright stone with a blue-pink tint.

# Chapter 4: New place, new meetings.

Days passed, Keko lived with Tilke, his parents perceived her as a pet or assistant, so they were not against her presence. 
This young man lived in a luxurious house, because his family was rich. 
But, despite the wealth, he would like to be an ordinary boy with a loving family. 
With the appearance of Keko in his house, he became a little happier, but he was still too weighed down by the idea that this was just a robot and she would not be able to fully understand him. 
By the way or to the sadness for Tilke, Akizora often began to come to him, of course, mainly for the sake of Keko, because for her she was an unusual friend and the only girl among 2 meager guys! 
Therefore, when an interesting girl came to Tilke, his room was filled with noise and laughter. 
Aki, as usual, harassed Keko with stupid questions and tried to grab her breasts, and meanwhile he silently watched and thought about something. 
You can't ask about his thoughts, he will just start to deny the question, but it was on this evening that Akizora decided to ask a question: 

- Tilke, she has been living with you for quite a long time, maybe it's time for her to go to school? 

To this, he frowned a little and looked at Aki: 

- Why? She's an android, she doesn't need to go to school like people, and it's safer for her here. 
- I think she's bored at your house, at school I Keko will learn to communicate with people and learn a lot of new things. 

Keko silently snuggled up a little to Akizora and slightly took her hand as support, she understood the whole situation, and she would very much like to discover a new territory called "school". 
But Tilke was not particularly happy with this idea, for him Keko is a robot, and his creation, almost his thing, his project, since when will she be equal to him? 
Akizora read the guy's expression and said: 

- Maybe for you it's a thing, but she has her own feelings and desires, don't forget that you weren't the only one involved in her creation! In addition, she even has a stone, which means she is more than just a machine! 

Tilke clenched his hands into fists a little and decided to remain silent, because he was only faithful to his point of view, but knowing Aki, she will definitely not lag behind him and get her way, so he had to obediently agree and create a fictional profile for her as a human. 
The documents were ready and accepted by the school, and the first day for Keko should come soon. 
Akizora decided to shelter her to herself, despite the meager housing. 
But even Keko was happy about this, she realized that Aki really sees a friend in her, and thanks to her, the robo-girl began to speak more emotionally, showing more interest. 
This day has come, Aki turns off Keko's sleep mode, although it's early morning now, you need to put her in order. 
While Akizora masks the iron parts of the android, a dialogue takes place between them: 

- Aki, you look like a chicken... 
- Why is that? 
- You sometimes sound like those yellow dog toys in the shape of a chicken... and I love ordinary chickens, although I have never seen them live, they look very fluffy and cute. 
- Don't even call me a chicken, it's offensive. 

Aki blushed a little and silently put Keko in order, she even gave her her school uniform, which no one even wears at school. 
And now Keke already looked like a human, an ordinary short girl, a new one in the class. 
The teacher introduced her, and Keko continued: 

- My name is Keko Reon, due to the hospital I communicate with difficulties a little, but I am very pleased to meet you. 

After these words, she sits down in a free seat next to Akizora, and after the lesson, curious classmates with various questions already flew to her. 
Keko, of course, answered everything, but this cacophony of sounds was interrupted by asoqwer: 

- Guys, stop throwing questions at her, I need to show her the school. 

Everyone immediately lagged behind, because Asoka was a favorite in the class, everyone wanted to stroke him, but he took Keko by the hand and pulled her away and led her into the corridor, where he finally becomes himself: 

- Don't let them throw themselves at you like that, or suddenly you'll say the wrong thing and it will cause suspicion. 

Keko blinked a couple of times and nodded, thinking a little: 
- A, well okay! It's just the first time that so many people, please don't be angry. 

asoqwer laughed awkwardly and lightly tapped Keko on the iron head and continued to show the school. 
A week later, the robo-girl had already settled in, she studied averagely, although she could have been perfect, but that would have attracted unnecessary attention. 
Every day her friends caught her, during breaks they chatted on the roof, like a secret club. 
In independent works, Akizora often poked Keko and asked for answers, and of course she received them. 
In physical education, she just sat on the bench, because her physical abilities exceeded human ones, and she had not yet learned to control them completely. 
Even Tilke was already used to Keko, but still chatted more with asoqwer. 

Everything was pretty peaceful, the girl sometimes went alone and it was on this day that a tall figure crashed into her. 
Rather, she crashed into him, because she was thinking about something. 
During the collision, the victim is usually the one who is shorter, but judging by the face of the hulk from the collision with Keko's 100 kilogram body, he felt obvious pain, as if he had crashed into a tombstone 150 cm tall. 
After flying back a little, he looked at Keko in surprise, scratched the back of his head, frowned, while she began to speak: 

- Are you okay? I was just thinking and didn't notice you. 

The guy came back to Earth a little: 

- Aah... Yes, I'm okay, uh bye! 

He was confused and ran away, leaving Keko in bewilderment. 
She forgot about it after a while, but the young man was in bewilderment. 
It definitely seemed to him! It can't be that a fragile, short girl is like a piece of pillar! 
This shocked guy's name was Simon Weber. 
He can't sit still, so he is a member of several sports clubs, in addition he also likes to sing. 
He is usually difficult to interest, but today's collision seemed to drive him crazy. 
Simon remembered this situation and the appearance of the girl. 
Something is clearly wrong here!

# Chapter 5: Help Simon!

Baffled by this phenomenon, Simon decided to follow this mysterious girl a little. 
From his memory, he definitely had never seen her, so he decided to ask his longtime friend Akizora: 
- Have you seen a short girl with purple hair and strange eyes at school? 
- Yes, this is a new one in my class. 
- Don't you think there's something wrong with her? Why does she wear a school uniform, although we have it free? 

Aki shrugged and was already going to go: 

- Maybe this is her image? I think she's fine, you're just exaggerating. 

These words ate into Simon's head and secretly he watched how Keko behaved, and after a day of watching he revealed several oddities: 
- Her face is almost always neutral. 
- Her voice is kind of strange. 
- She is overly polite and answers everything that is asked of her. 
- She doesn't go to physical education! How can you do that? 
- She always hangs out with Tilke, Akizora and asoqwer. 
- Her grades are an average score, always always they are average, can a person always answer the same? 
- She doesn't eat during lunch, even when everyone around is eating, they don't share with her. 

Simon felt like he was starting to go crazy, maybe this is really an ordinary girl, but with peculiarities? 
It was already evening and he decided to go to the roof for the last time, and saw Akizora and Keko there, he sighed sadly and decided to watch what they were doing one last time. 
As soon as he approached a little, he saw that Keko... has no head! 
It was lying on the floor, and the body was trying to find the head! 
Simon was horrified, he was like a torpedo, just ran away and almost jumped off the roof, but fortunately he ran into the toilet and began to think. 
He definitely went crazy, a person cannot fall off his head for the body to work! 
Simon's knees were shaking, he turned pale he became almost white even though he was swarthy. 
But he knew that if he didn't ask her personally he wouldn't be able to sleep, but suddenly this question would kill him? 
He comes out of the toilet and next saw Keko, who was looking directly at him. 
It seemed to him that her eyes gave off an evil red glow. 
Simon began to sweat, even his ass sweated, he trembled and silently looked at her, as if he was already ready to die. 
Keko, looking around and seeing that no one was around, grabbed his hand and pushed him into the toilet. 
Simon was shocked where did such strength come from in such small hands? 
But she began to speak, a little gloomy in her face: 

- Did you see me on the roof? 

Simon nodded frightenedly. 
And Keko continued: 

- I'll explain everything to you, but if you blab you will have consequences. 

Simon started nodding very quickly. 

- In general, I am a robot, but only my friends know about it and we are all hiding it. 
And today Aki pushed me hard and my head flew off because of my imperfect design. 

Simon sat scared on the toilet because in this position he was at her eye level, but Keko continued: 
- My body is heavier and stronger than usual, so don't be surprised anymore. 

Simon calmed down a little and was able to speak, but with pauses: 

- And why... are we in the men's room? 
- Because there are no cameras here, what did you think? 
- ... 

After that day, Simon was afraid of Keko at first, but then he himself broke down to Akizora, and their dialogue somehow reached the stones and it turns out that Simon also has one - Carnelian, a stone of the heart. 
Gradually, even Tilke agreed to accept him into his circle, and Keko was the happiest of all. 

To be continued...
